Essential AngularJS Demos
===========

Welcome to our demos repository for 
[Essential Angularjs](https://www.develop.com/training-course/essential-angularjs-client-side-programming-with-javascript) 
from [DevelopMentor](https://develop.com). 

If you are in one of our courses *right now*, **start by selecting your course's branch** and then just click 'Download ZIP' or clone this repo to your system. On the other hand, if you took the course awhile ago and want access to the demos, your course probably lives **in another branch**. Use the branches dropdown to find it or just contact us (requests@develop.com).

Course Outline
----------------------

**What you will learn in this course**

This course on AngularJS will teach you how to develop client browser based applications using the AngularJS framework. You will learn how to use the open source AngularJS framework and combine this with powerful REST services on the back-end to build Single Page Applications (SPA). With the knowledge gained from this course you will be able to create your own rich and powerful SPAs that keep all their state in the browser and communicate with RESTful services on the backend in order to retrieve and persist data.

**Course highlights**

Learn how to use the AngularJS framework in a modern web application. Understand the advantaged of SPA style web applications. Learn how to use REST services from your AngularJS application. Create custom HTML elements using AngularJS directives.

**Course outline and topics**

**Day 1**

**JavaScript Refresher**

JavaScript is a deceptive language. Its name suggest that it’s a scripting version of Java but that is not the case. In this module we will take a look at some of the JavaScript features that are important to understand when working with a framework like AngularJS.

**AngularJS Introduction**

This module provides in an overview of the AngularJS Model View Controller framework. After this module you will have a basic understanding of the different parts of the AngularJS architecture and how to use them.

**Services & Factories**

Moving functionality from controllers into reusable services makes for a much better architected application and is considered a best practice. In this module you will learn about most of the standard services AngularJS provides as well as how to create your own. We will also take a look at the different options for creating reusable modules and services you can use.

**Day 2**

**AngularJS and Ajax**

There are few applications that do not need to communicate with the server using AJAX calls. In this module we will take a look at the $http and $resource services provided by AngularJS to perform AJAX requests. You will learn how to interact with server-side RESTful services asynchronously using AngularJS’s built-in networking features.

**Data entry using AngularJS**

CRUD applications are the bread and butter of AngularJS applications. In this module we will examine the different features AngularJS offers to create data entry forms and perform data validation on the client.

**Using Routing to create SPAs**

Traditional web applications perform full page loads when the user navigates from page to page. In this module you will learn how to use the routing features of AngularJS to create an application where this navigation is done only on the client’s machine. This allows us not only to navigate much faster but also to retain state on the client browser between the different parts of our application.

**Day 3**

**AngularJS Patterns**

When building AngularJS application you will be faced with many choices. For example when to use a service or a factory, where to do validation or when to use the routing module resolve option versus dependency injection. In this module we will take a closer look at some of these choices and explore the pros and cons of the different options.

**Building custom AngularJS Directives**

AngularJS ships with an impressive and very useful set of standard directives, yet they are only the beginning. In this module you will learn how to enhance and expand the HTML language by creating your own custom AngularJS directives. These custom directives will let you add behavior to DOM elements as well as create reusable UI widgets. Using the techniques learned in this module, you will be able to turn HTML into your own domain specific language (DSL).

**Testing AngularJS applications**

The way AngularJS is architected results in a highly testable application. In this module you will learn the various ways of testing your own application. We will look at both unit testing individual components as well as doing end-to-end testing of the complete application by automating the browser.
